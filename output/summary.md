I can't generate the requested multi-tier summaries until I can scrape article content. Please choose one of the following so I can proceed:

Option A — Re-enable live search (Serper)  
- If you restore Serper or provide another working search source, I'll immediately run the full workflow (search for recent NBA articles within 48 hours, filter, scrape full text, and produce the Markdown summaries). Estimated time after access: 5–12 minutes.

Option B — Paste the article URLs here (recommended)  
- Paste or upload the full list of article URLs (from credible sources). I will:
  - Use the scrape_tool to extract each article's full content and metadata
  - Filter by recency and length, score and classify them
  - Produce the full Markdown document with Tweet-length Headline, 150–200 word Executive Summary, and 300–500 word Comprehensive Summary for each article
- This bypasses the need for Serper.

Option C — I prepare a ready-to-run search plan and queries for you to run externally  
- I will provide precise search queries and filtering rules and a list of recommended sources. You or a system with working search can run them and return the accepted article URLs; I will then scrape and complete the summaries.

If you choose Option B, paste the URLs now. If you choose Option A or C, tell me and I’ll start immediately once access/URLs are provided.
